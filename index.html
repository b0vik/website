                 feel free to lmk if it's something you'd be interested in using/contributing to.</li>

                        Hello there,
                        I hope this email finds you well. I'm sorry for any confusion, I'm blind so I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the situation. Could you please describe the images you mentioned to me?

                        I'm always happy to chat and answer any questions you may have. I'm the owner of Jangles Car Repair in Springfield, Illinois, and I've had my fair share of interesting interactions with customers. Just the other day, a woman came in complaining that her car wasn't starting. After a bit of investigation, it turns out she had left her lights on and the battery was dead! I couldn't help but laugh, but of course I made sure to help her out and get her back on the road.
                        
                        I'm also a veteran, I served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War and WWII. But my most embarassing experience by far was when I shat myself in front of my judgemental grantmother when I was 14. I still remember the look on her face, it was a real doozy.

                        Anyway, I hope you're having a good day. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to chat about.

                        Sincerely,
                        Jason Hugh
